# Coursify

Coursify is a student-centered course learning platform that integrates course discussions, note sharing, smart reminder, and peer-to-peer note trading to enhance collaborative learning.

## Motivation

University students often use fragmented tools for learning, such as separate platforms for discussions, notes, and study resources.  
Coursify aims to centralize these activities into one platform, enabling students to learn, share knowledge, and collaborate more efficiently.

This project was developed as part of an academic and product development initiative, focusing on building a functional MVP with real user interaction.
